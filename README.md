# OnTrack - Web
*Owner: Jillian Sands (jesands21@gmail.com)*
## Motivation
Even as a lifelong Maryland resident, the D.C. metro can be daunting to navigate! This projects aims to facilitate the process of riding the WMATA metro by creating a web app with their APIs. 

## Usage

 - This app can be pulled down and ran locally using the command `node OnTrack.js`
 - Alternatively, the site is deployed at [https://ontrack-3p50.onrender.com/](https://ontrack-3p50.onrender.com/)

## Tech Stack 
This project was originally my final project for CMSC335: Web Application Development with JavaScript. I utilized the technologies taught in this class including JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. Later, I added React to complete the MERN stack and refactored the Javascript files to Typescript.
